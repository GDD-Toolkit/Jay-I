# Project Title

**Jay-I** is a unique project that blends the philosophical insights of Jay Drydyk with the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The primary goal of Jay-I is to serve as a tool for integrating development ethics into stakeholder project proposals and plans. Development ethics focuses on assessing the societal impact of projects and ensuring that development efforts contribute to meaningful and positive outcomes.

## Why Jay-I?
Incorporating development ethics into project planning and management is crucial for prioritizing the needs and satisfaction of citizens affected by the project. Jay-I addresses this need by providing a platform where users can input project details, roles, and other relevant information. The input is then processed by ChatGPT, an AI model, to analyze and incorporate the ethical implications of the project. Users receive valuable insights to visualize and resolve ethical considerations, enhancing their ability to integrate development ethics into their projects.

Jay-I will be seamlessly integrated into the [Development Ethics Toolkit website](https://gdd.toolkitme.com/). Users will access the link, fill out project details, submit the form, and ChatGPT will generate a proposal that incorporates development ethics.

/*
This is an example of what the NavBar code should look like. When importing the NavBar to any page, one would have to include the
the title property so that it can be displayed in a way demonstrated below:

import React from "react";

interface props {
    title: String;
}

const NavBar = ({title}: props): React.ReactElement => {
    return (
        <div>{title}</div>
    );
}

export default NavBar;
